From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened</p><p>View in browser<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.com/2021/unity-weta-and-faceless-platforms/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvdW5pdHktd2V0YS1hbmQtZmFjZWxlc3MtcGxhdGZvcm1zLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNjM5ODI2MTg5LCJpYXQiOjE2MzcyMzQxODksImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCIsInN1YiI6IkJYcmVMcW15RzJNYUVxVHVqeDRuR3YiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.RDQ-zWLmcAjONTMR5cE_-y0JK8ncLU0l01JX9hDbI3BRLEWHDSFfeD14AulGxcWiyZqUbuFLOh5trIrpvfeVD4kZUU-Qf5Ghk4r8nYu3XcTyLcZWEGsdEDnFeZKCrI06exaeX1DVTamsPo1CNIB4WxLK6dMewroj3LDS8IJ9HCgLc_DTMIZgKAZYILK7ILiunFp2wy1URMptuyy4uSmgdNOrkO42gh_yGoacDJSuyiVvpeDLCkis3usTMalLJGIZK3G_Zux3vjhV9NBAESZYMduJRMRPOhIxP0hA5P7hJjrGJCSRJM_yJbOjcyBfrUICf04aQyodCI-wTOw4UDHHKA&gt;<br/>[image: STRATECHERY] &lt;https://stratechery.com/&gt;Unity, Weta, and Faceless Platforms<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.com/2021/unity-weta-and-faceless-platforms/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvdW5pdHktd2V0YS1hbmQtZmFjZWxlc3MtcGxhdGZvcm1zLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNjM5ODI2MTg5LCJpYXQiOjE2MzcyMzQxODksImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCIsInN1YiI6IkJYcmVMcW15RzJNYUVxVHVqeDRuR3YiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.RDQ-zWLmcAjONTMR5cE_-y0JK8ncLU0l01JX9hDbI3BRLEWHDSFfeD14AulGxcWiyZqUbuFLOh5trIrpvfeVD4kZUU-Qf5Ghk4r8nYu3XcTyLcZWEGsdEDnFeZKCrI06exaeX1DVTamsPo1CNIB4WxLK6dMewroj3LDS8IJ9HCgLc_DTMIZgKAZYILK7ILiunFp2wy1URMptuyy4uSmgdNOrkO42gh_yGoacDJSuyiVvpeDLCkis3usTMalLJGIZK3G_Zux3vjhV9NBAESZYMduJRMRPOhIxP0hA5P7hJjrGJCSRJM_yJbOjcyBfrUICf04aQyodCI-wTOw4UDHHKA&gt;<br/>*Thursday, November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime;

And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go.

understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving this email because you are subscribed to Stratechery<br/>&lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;.</p><p>Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/member/login?email=zindlerb%40gmail.com&gt;to view your account and manage your subscriptions.Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/api/1.0.0/users/BXreLqmyG2MaEqTujx4nGv/channelOptOut?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL2FwaS8xLjAuMC91c2Vycy9CWHJlTHFteUcyTWFFcVR1ang0bkd2L2NoYW5uZWxPcHRPdXQ_Y2hhbm5lbD1lbWFpbFx1MDAyNnJlZGlyZWN0X3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSUyRm1lbWJlciUyRnVuc3Vic2NyaWJlIl19LCJleHAiOjE2Mzk4MjYxODksImlhdCI6MTYzNzIzNDE4OSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6Im1lbWJlcjp3cml0ZSIsInN1YiI6IkJYcmVMcW15RzJNYUVxVHVqeDRuR3YiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.ApHo9L6dssQNAPdLl744KCSTGJDAoSclKxkQngMGN0HY4z0KH8Kve5cBhr7INqLZ8XOeKnLMDv7rXvk4R76rHKPhXDkW3hzQrxgA89ohRuiyGqDR72Aezykw052zurdolQAA0hJjnsWIWvtB-Cn2w2cGJpyJphpwJOpA_B0WVyBAKBgqSmqBCklr7bpeEEDx7FfYq53fJ_ukOcss3I8yZQiyVcWlMxoEapZrbkuFCjZMaOSVSkTMSLo3Pf72ivEeCosIPXzVdvYJIvwwYwkr_m8MpGEHKwPFY1oojbwo-9ElvWr6FVQ3E5SpD3-YUJ7f0r6R59_UiEQutE0Ude-YMw&amp;channel=email&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.passport.online%2Fmember%2Funsubscribe&gt;to unsubscribe.</p><p>*[image: ©] 2021 Stratechery LLC &lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;, 2093Philadelphia Pike #9930, Claymont DE 19703*</p><p>eeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI.

I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services.

TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them,

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially.

These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume.

From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much

to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also

Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving this email because you are subscribed to Stratechery<br/>&lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;.</p><p>Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/member/login?email=zindlerb%40gmail.com&gt;to view your account and manage your subscriptions.Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/api/1.0.0/users/BXreLqmyG2MaEqTujx4nGv/channelOptOut?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL2FwaS8xLjAuMC91c2Vycy9CWHJlTHFteUcyTWFFcVR1ang0bkd2L2NoYW5uZWxPcHRPdXQ_Y2hhbm5lbD1lbWFpbFx1MDAyNnJlZGlyZWN0X3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSUyRm1lbWJlciUyRnVuc3Vic2NyaWJlIl19LCJleHAiOjE2Mzk4MjYxODksImlhdCI6MTYzNzIzNDE4OSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6Im1lbWJlcjp3cml0ZSIsInN1YiI6IkJYcmVMcW15RzJNYUVxVHVqeDRuR3YiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.ApHo9L6dssQNAPdLl744KCSTGJDAoSclKxkQngMGN0HY4z0KH8Kve5cBhr7INqLZ8XOeKnLMDv7rXvk4R76rHKPhXDkW3hzQrxgA89ohRuiyGqDR72Aezykw052zurdolQAA0hJjnsWIWvtB-Cn2w2cGJpyJphpwJOpA_B0WVyBAKBgqSmqBCklr7bpeEEDx7FfYq53fJ_ukOcss3I8yZQiyVcWlMxoEapZrbkuFCjZMaOSVSkTMSLo3Pf72ivEeCosIPXzVdvYJIvwwYwkr_m8MpGEHKwPFY1oojbwo-9ElvWr6FVQ3E5SpD3-YUJ7f0r6R59_UiEQutE0Ude-YMw&amp;channel=email&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.passport.online%2Fmember%2Funsubscribe&gt;to unsubscribe.</p><p>*[image: ©] 2021 Stratechery LLC &lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;, 2093Philadelphia Pike #9930, Claymont DE 19703*</p><p>d], we went from one computer to 30 computers. It was a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*.

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future.

understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future.

From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving this email because you are subscribed to Stratechery<br/>&lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;.</p><p>Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/member/login?email=zindlerb%40gmail.com&gt;to view your account and manage your subscriptions.Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/api/1.0.0/users/BXreLqmyG2MaEqTujx4nGv/channelOptOut?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL2FwaS8xLjAuMC91c2Vycy9CWHJlTHFteUcyTWFFcVR1ang0bkd2L2NoYW5uZWxPcHRPdXQ_Y2hhbm5lbD1lbWFpbFx1MDAyNnJlZGlyZWN0X3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSUyRm1lbWJlciUyRnVuc3Vic2NyaWJlIl19LCJleHAiOjE2Mzk4MjYxODksImlhdCI6MTYzNzIzNDE4OSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6Im1lbWJlcjp3cml0ZSIsInN1YiI6IkJYcmVMcW15RzJNYUVxVHVqeDRuR3YiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.ApHo9L6dssQNAPdLl744KCSTGJDAoSclKxkQngMGN0HY4z0KH8Kve5cBhr7INqLZ8XOeKnLMDv7rXvk4R76rHKPhXDkW3hzQrxgA89ohRuiyGqDR72Aezykw052zurdolQAA0hJjnsWIWvtB-Cn2w2cGJpyJphpwJOpA_B0WVyBAKBgqSmqBCklr7bpeEEDx7FfYq53fJ_ukOcss3I8yZQiyVcWlMxoEapZrbkuFCjZMaOSVSkTMSLo3Pf72ivEeCosIPXzVdvYJIvwwYwkr_m8MpGEHKwPFY1oojbwo-9ElvWr6FVQ3E5SpD3-YUJ7f0r6R59_UiEQutE0Ude-YMw&amp;channel=email&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.passport.online%2Fmember%2Funsubscribe&gt;to unsubscribe.</p><p>*[image: ©] 2021 Stratechery LLC &lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;, 2093Philadelphia Pike #9930, Claymont DE 19703*</p><p>between movie-making and software-development was tight in a way that isonly possible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film.

It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*.

Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future.

The feedback loop between movie-makingand software-development was tight in a way that is only possible with afully integrated approach, resulting in dramatic improvements from film tofilm. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially.

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving this email because you are subscribed to Stratechery<br/>&lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;.</p><p>Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/member/login?email=zindlerb%40gmail.com&gt;to view your account and manage your subscriptions.Click here<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/api/1.0.0/users/BXreLqmyG2MaEqTujx4nGv/channelOptOut?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJlbnQiOnsidXJpIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRlY2hlcnkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL2FwaS8xLjAuMC91c2Vycy9CWHJlTHFteUcyTWFFcVR1ang0bkd2L2NoYW5uZWxPcHRPdXQ_Y2hhbm5lbD1lbWFpbFx1MDAyNnJlZGlyZWN0X3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSUyRm1lbWJlciUyRnVuc3Vic2NyaWJlIl19LCJleHAiOjE2Mzk4MjYxODksImlhdCI6MTYzNzIzNDE4OSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6Im1lbWJlcjp3cml0ZSIsInN1YiI6IkJYcmVMcW15RzJNYUVxVHVqeDRuR3YiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.ApHo9L6dssQNAPdLl744KCSTGJDAoSclKxkQngMGN0HY4z0KH8Kve5cBhr7INqLZ8XOeKnLMDv7rXvk4R76rHKPhXDkW3hzQrxgA89ohRuiyGqDR72Aezykw052zurdolQAA0hJjnsWIWvtB-Cn2w2cGJpyJphpwJOpA_B0WVyBAKBgqSmqBCklr7bpeEEDx7FfYq53fJ_ukOcss3I8yZQiyVcWlMxoEapZrbkuFCjZMaOSVSkTMSLo3Pf72ivEeCosIPXzVdvYJIvwwYwkr_m8MpGEHKwPFY1oojbwo-9ElvWr6FVQ3E5SpD3-YUJ7f0r6R59_UiEQutE0Ude-YMw&amp;channel=email&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.passport.online%2Fmember%2Funsubscribe&gt;to unsubscribe.</p><p>*[image: ©] 2021 Stratechery LLC &lt;https://www.stratechery.com/&gt;, 2093Philadelphia Pike #9930, Claymont DE 19703*</p><p>me for Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI.

Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*.

Mobile, though, thanksto its always connected nature and massive market size, moved towards acombination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unity found itselfperfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile game developers had thesame problem that Unity could solve once and make available to all of itscustomers, and second, advertising in particular requires far more scalethan any one game developer could build on its own. Unity, though, couldbuild an advertising market across all of the games it supported — whichagain, was most of them — and its customers could rely on Unity knowingthat their interests were aligned: if developers made money, Unity mademoney.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity.

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated fromthe movie shot to the development process to the software to the individualcomputer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken offand modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal enginefor *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the engine wasbuilt for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once developmentwas completed then the engine was made available to other developers tobuild their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that idor Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond itsApple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpoweredrelative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primarygoal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to delivergood enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most ofthe developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teamsand independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if theycould fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Applefriendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers,both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and arehanding them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working onfilms beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and *Avengers*.This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capitalintensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there isboth an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return onthe initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the softwareis used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software developmentand software application were still integrated, because there was so muchmore improvement to be had; Jackson again:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:<br/>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four.

I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized andleveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>*Today*, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described *today*’s webas being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3Dtools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants likeFacebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt; or Microsoft<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unity isn’t competingfor end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those newexperiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC canbuild chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering toachieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.</p><p>*Subscription Information*Member: Brian Zindler<br/>Email: zindlerb@gmail.com<br/>Plan type: Free</p><p>You are receiving

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created andare handing them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, workingon films beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and<br/>*Avengers*. This too makes sense: developing software is both incrediblycapital intensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that meansthere is both an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing thereturn on the initial investment, and a product motive, since every timethe software is used there is the potential for improvement. Still,software development and software application were still integrated,because there was so much more improvement to be had; Jackson again:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integratedfrom the movie shot to the development process to the software to theindividual computer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been brokenoff and modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unrealengine for *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the enginewas built for the game, and the game was built for the engine; oncedevelopment was completed then the engine was made available to otherdevelopers to build their own games, without having to recreate all of thework that id or Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyondits Apple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramaticallyunderpowered relative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant thatthe primary goal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics,but to deliver good enough graphics in a power-constrained environment.Moreover, most of the developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunitywere small teams and independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engineseven if they could fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’tjust Apple friendly, but also built from the ground-up for independentdevelopers, both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases.

TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;. In the process,though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise ofsmartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitorslike Intel.</p><p>By 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based onExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishlydifficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years ofdevelopment by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for theabsolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the mostadvanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in theworld, and, absent geopolitical risk<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/pZ5FDQEfM&gt;, a clear winner in aworld increasingly experienced via technology.</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity isparticularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTCkeynote &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/4P83Y1Efp&gt; described<br/>*today*’s web as being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity ownsthe best 3D tools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverseaspirants like Facebook &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/NE83D1x4M&gt;or Microsoft &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/KW83D1xfp&gt;, Unityisn’t competing for end users, which means it can partner with everyonebuilding those new experiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple<br/>— just as TSMC can build chips for everyone, even Intel.</p><p>It is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/5F5FD1x4M&gt; or Shopify<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/0s83YQE4p&gt; or the public clouds<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/T253DQEfM&gt; — that are the mostimportant to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has alwaysbeen platforms, but in the beginning era of technology<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/f583D1x4p&gt; the most importantplatforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’smiddle era the most important platforms will be faceless<br/>&lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/ON83Y1x4M&gt;, empowering developersand artists and creators of all types to create completely new experienceson top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained andimproved on by companies that aren’t competing with them,

November 18*, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created andare handing them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, workingon films beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and<br/>*Avengers*. This too makes sense: developing software is both incrediblycapital intensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that meansthere is both an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing thereturn on the initial investment, and a product motive, since every timethe software is used there is the potential for improvement. Still,software development and software application were still integrated,because there was so much more improvement to be had; Jackson again:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integratedfrom the movie shot to the development process to the software to theindividual computer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been brokenoff and modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unrealengine for *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the enginewas built for the game, and the game was built for the engine; oncedevelopment was completed then the engine was made available to otherdevelopers to build their own games, without having to recreate all of thework that id or Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds *today*: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyondits Apple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramaticallyunderpowered relative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant thatthe primary goal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics,but to deliver good enough graphics in a power-constrained environment.Moreover, most of the developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunitywere small teams and independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engineseven if they could fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’tjust Apple friendly, but also built from the ground-up for independentdevelopers, both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>*Today* it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including itsadvertising network and in-app purchase support, plus other services likehosting and multiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue;Create Solutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription toUnity’s development tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-rampto the former; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earningscall<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity.

Thursday,November 18, 2021</p><p>At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital&gt;, Peter Jackson,filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, theCEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digitalover (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dswQNrji?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* We knew that digital effects offered so much possibilityfor us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we wereimagining.</p><p>*Prem Akkaraju:* Now we’re taking those tools that we have created andare handing them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.</p><p>*Peter Jackson:* Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway forany artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage theseincredible creative tools.</p><p>The creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great exampleof how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes overtime; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great homefor Weta.<br/>Weta’s Integrated History</p><p>Peter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital afterseeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; thefirst movie Weta worked on was *Heavenly Creature*, which Jackson saysdidn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital<br/>&lt;https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/KP1IHnX3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe inthe water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it,and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in HeavenlyCreatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’dactually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, whichwas the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. Itwas a pretty big jump.”</p><p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, wasintegrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to makegraphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film thatneeded graphics to give his team a reason to get started on makingsoftware. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotalrole in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The feedback loop betweenmovie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is onlypossible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramaticimprovements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/XlL0DfMQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which hasGollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completelydifferent to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [Thatfirst] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good aswe could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but weput a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’tlook very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what wehad to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really goodfor the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollumwas a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got tothe place that we wanted to go.”</p><p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, workingon films beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including *Avatar* and<br/>*Avengers*. This too makes sense: developing software is both incrediblycapital intensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that meansthere is both an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing thereturn on the initial investment, and a product motive, since every timethe software is used there is the potential for improvement. Still,software development and software application were still integrated,because there was so much more improvement to be had; Jackson again:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/2fsYzYaT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a widevariety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because wekeep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a fewyears ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, thatcan blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with TheHobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Whycan’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the<br/>[prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind ofcode, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of thesoftware, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna doeverything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want theAvatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better thanlast time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole newleaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort ofdrives me crazy.</p><p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jacksonstarts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; hesays at the end:</p><p>&lt;https://videopress.com/embed/dfR3z7dK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&gt;</p><p>We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI.There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script,or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’vesimply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know,every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is importantbecause when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking,you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot witha little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get itlooking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, andmaybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computersthat are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing thisstuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.</p><p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integratedfrom the movie shot to the development process to the software to theindividual computer:</p><p>[image: Weta&#39;s integration]</p><p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been brokenoff and modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from thesoftware itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is thelogical endpoint.<br/>Unity’s Modular History</p><p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines weredeveloped for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software,which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its<br/>*Quake* series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unrealengine for *Unreal Tournament*. These were integrated efforts: the enginewas built for the game, and the game was built for the engine; oncedevelopment was completed then the engine was made available to otherdevelopers to build their own games, without having to recreate all of thework that id or Epic had already done.</p><p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of<br/>“democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, *GooBall*, wasintended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac,which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business.That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store:that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home onApple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was offto the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically andmobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds today: 71% of the top1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion peopleplay games it powers.</p><p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyondits Apple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramaticallyunderpowered relative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant thatthe primary goal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics,but to deliver good enough graphics in a power-constrained environment.Moreover, most of the developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunitywere small teams and independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engineseven if they could fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’tjust Apple friendly, but also built from the ground-up for independentdevelopers, both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p><p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, andas the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilitiesand performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console andPC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantlyin virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position asa developer’s partner, not a competitor.<br/>Unity’s Business Model</p><p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out thatmobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or consolegaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile,though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size,moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unityfound itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile gamedevelopers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and makeavailable to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particularrequires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own.Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games itsupported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely onUnity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money,Unity made money.</p><p>Today it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertisingnetwork and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting andmultiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; CreateSolutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’sdevelopment tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to theformer; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call<br/>&lt;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/&gt;<br/>:</p><p>We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building outtheir first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook themlots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. Theystart as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then weget inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then theywrite bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I wouldhate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land andexpand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.</p><p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unityhas negative churn because its existing customers increase their spendingwith Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had agreat one in their S-1<br/>&lt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm&gt;<br/>:</p><p>[image: Unity&#39;s S-1 cohort analysis]</p><p>This shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers:the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customersindefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate ishow many new customers it can bring on board.</p><p>Enter Weta.<br/>Unity + Weta</p><p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta andUnity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology,but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continuesto improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on itsplatform and integration with all of the other components a developer needsto build a business.</p><p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these twopaths:</p><p>- Weta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productizedand leveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.<br/>- Unity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and onlylimited by its ability to acquire new customers.</p><p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not justdevelopers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expandmodel. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investmentit has made in its software tools.</p><p>[image: The convergence of Unity and Weta&#39;s paths]</p><p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: theconvergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes.Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobilemarket; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers thatits developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make thingsthat were never before possible.</p><p>Today, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power,to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes itpossible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve andincreasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p><p>That’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me inan interview &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/Yz5FYQxfp&gt;:</p><p>It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to somethingthat this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use,and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve gotthousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at makingthese tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games,make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, butthey can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s theauto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineeringconstruction, or in digital twins.</p><p>These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to cometo an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited aboutthe prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what Iwould tell you is this is one of those things where you write down thestrategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years,and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.</p><p>It’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there areobvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are sodifferent; it is precisely those differences, though, that make thisacquisition so compelling.<br/>Faceless Platforms</p><p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is notEpic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC,like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers,not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route tomarket &lt;https://stratechery.passport.online/l/b983Y1xfp&gt;.
